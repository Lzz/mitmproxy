mitmproxy protocol architecture

In mitmproxy, protocols are implemented as a set of layers, which are composed on top each other.
For example, the following scenarios depict possible scenarios (lowest layer first):

Transparent HTTP proxy, no SSL:
    TransparentModeLayer
    HttpLayer

Regular proxy, CONNECT request with WebSockets over SSL:
    RegularModeLayer
    HttpLayer
    SslLayer
    WebsocketLayer (or TcpLayer)

Automated protocol detection by peeking into the buffer:
    TransparentModeLayer
    AutoLayer
    SslLayer
    AutoLayer
    Http2Layer

Communication between layers is done as follows:
    - lower layers provide context information to higher layers
    - higher layers can "yield" commands to lower layers,
      which are propagated until they reach a suitable layer.

Further goals:
  - Connections should always be peekable to make automatic protocol detection work.
  - Upstream connections should be established as late as possible;
    inline scripts shall have a chance to handle everything locally.
